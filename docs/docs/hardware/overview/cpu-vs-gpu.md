## CPU vs. GPU

|                     | CPU                                                                      | GPU                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Function**        | Generalized component that handles main processing functions of a server | Specialized component that excels at parallel computing |
| **Processing**      | Designed for serial instruction processing                               | Designed for parallel instruction processing            |
| **Design**          | Fewer, more powerful cores                                               | More cores than CPUs, but less powerful than CPU cores  |
| **Best suited for** | General-purpose computing applications                                   | High-performance computing applications                 |
