The following steps will help you troubleshoot and resolve issues related to broken builds.

1. Unistall Jan

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
    
    Delete Jan from your `/Applications` folder
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

    To uninstall Jan on Windows, use the [Windows Control Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uninstall-or-remove-apps-and-programs-in-windows-4b55f974-2cc6-2d2b-d092-5905080eaf98).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

    To uninstall Jan on Linux, you should use your package manager's uninstall or remove option. For Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions, if you installed Jan via the `.deb` package, you can uninstall Jan using the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get remove jan
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. Delete the application data, cache, and user data folders

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
    
    ```bash
    # Step 1: Delete the application data
    ## Newer versions
    rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/jan
    ## Versions 0.2.0 and older
    rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/jan-electron
    
    # Step 2: Clear application cache
    rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/jan*

    # Step 3: Remove all user data
    rm -rf ~/jan
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
  
    ```bash
    # You can delete the `/Jan` directory in Windows's AppData Directory by visiting the following path `%APPDATA%\Jan`
    cd C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming
    rmdir /S jan
    ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
  
    ```bash
    # You can delete the user data folders located at the following `~/jan`
    rm -rf ~/jan
    ```
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

3. If you are using version before `0.4.2` you need to run the following commands

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
    
    ```bash
    ps aux | grep nitro
    # Looks for processes like `nitro` and `nitro_arm_64`, and kill them one by one by process ID
    kill -9 <PID>
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
  
    ```bash
    # Find the process ID (PID) of the nitro process by filtering the list by process name
    tasklist | findstr "nitro"
    # Once you have the PID of the process you want to terminate, run the `taskkill`
    taskkill /F /PID <PID>
    ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
  
    ```bash
    ps aux | grep nitro
    # Looks for processes like `nitro` and `nitro_arm_64`, and kill them one by one by process ID
    kill -9 <PID>
    ```
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
