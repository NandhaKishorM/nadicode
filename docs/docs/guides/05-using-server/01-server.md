Jan ships with a built-in API server, that can be used as a drop-in, local replacement for OpenAI's API.

Jan runs on port `1337` by default, but this can (soon) be changed in Settings.

1. Go to Settings > Advanced > Enable API Server

2. Go to http://localhost:1337 for the API docs.

3. In terminal, simply CURL...

Note: Some UI states may be broken when in Server Mode.
