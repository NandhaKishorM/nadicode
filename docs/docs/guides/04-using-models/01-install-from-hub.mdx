In this guide, we will walk through the process of installing a **Large Language Model (LLM)** from the Hub.

## Steps to Install Models from the Hub

### 1. Explore and Select a Model

Explore the available LLMs by scrolling through the Hub or using the **Search Bar**.

Utilize the **Filter Button** to choose the **recommended LLM**. LLM is recommended based on the [RAM usage](https://github.com/janhq/jan/issues/1384).

If you want to use a model that is not available in the Hub, you can also [import the Model Manually](./02-import-manually.mdx).

### 2. Download the Model

Once you've identified the desired LLM, simply click the **Download** button to initiate the download. A progress bar will appear to indicate the download progress.
