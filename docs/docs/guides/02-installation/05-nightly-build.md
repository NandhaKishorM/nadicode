:::warning

- Nightly releases are cutting-edge versions that include the latest features. However, they are highly unstable and may contain bugs.

:::

## Where to Find Nightly Releases

- **Jan's GitHub Repository**: Visit the [Download section](https://github.com/janhq/jan?tab=readme-ov-file#download) of Jan's GitHub repository for the latest nightly release.

- **Discord Channel**: Nightly releases are also announced in our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/1107178041848909847/1191638499355537418).

## Automatic Updates

Once you install a nightly build, the application will automatically prompt you to update each time it is restarted, ensuring you always have the latest version.

## Running Stable and Nightly Versions Simultaneously

If you wish to use both the stable and nightly versions of Jan, follow these steps:

1. Install the stable version as usual.
2. For the nightly build, choose a different installation directory to avoid conflicts.
3. Ensure that you clearly label or create shortcuts for each version to avoid confusion.
