Jan believes in the need for an **open source AI ecosystem**. We are focused on building the infra and tooling to allow open source AIs to compete on a level playing field with proprietary ones.

Jan's long-term technical endeavor is to build a cognitive framework for future robots, who are practical, useful assistants for humans and businesses in everyday life.

## Quicklinks

- Core product vision for [Jan Framework](../docs)
- R&D and model training efforts [Discord](https://discord.gg/9NfUSyzp3y) (via our small data-center which is `free & open to all researchers who lack GPUs`!)
- Current implementations of Jan Framework: [Jan Desktop](https://jan.ai/), [Nitro](https://nitro.jan.ai/)

## Why does Jan Exist?

### Mission

Our current mission is to allow humans and businesses to **own their AI, with the right to tinker, repair and innovate**.

:::tip
Our life-long mission is to **eliminate work - so human can focus on creation, invention, and moral governance over robots**.

### Ideal Customer

Our ideal customer is an AI enthusiast or business who has experienced some limitations with current AI solutions and is keen to find open source alternatives.

### Problems

Our ideal customer would use Jan to solve one of these problems.

_Control_

- Control (e.g. preventing vendor lock-in)
- Stability (e.g. runs predictably every time)
- Local-use (e.g. for speed, or for airgapped environments)

_Privacy_

- Data protection (e.g. personal data or company data)
- Privacy (e.g. nsfw)

_Customisability_

- Tinkerability (e.g. ability to change model, experiment)
- Niche Models (e.g. fine-tuned, domain-specific models that outperform OpenAI)

### Solution

Jan is a seamless user experience that runs on your personal computer, that glues the different pieces of the open source AI ecosystem to provide an alternative to OpenAI's closed platform.

- We build a comprehensive, seamless platform that takes care of the technical chores across the stack required to run open source AI
- We run on top of a local folder of non-proprietary files, that anyone can tinker with (yes, even other apps!)
- We provide open formats for packaging and distributing AI to run reproducibly across devices

## How Jan Works

- [Jan's Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/janhq/projects/5/views/29)
- [Jan's Newsletter](https://newsletter.jan.ai)

### Remote Team

Jan has a fully-remote team. We are mainly based in the APAC timezone. We use [Discord](https://discord.gg/af6SaTdzpx) and [Github](https://github.com/janhq) to work.

### Bootstrapped

Jan is currently a bootstrapped, founder funded startup.

We balance technical invention with the search for a sustainable business model. Thus, we appreciate any business inquiries that can balance growth with cashflow.

**We invite you to join us on our journey to find PMF**. Join our [Discord here](https://discord.gg/BnHRr3Q7Ms)

### Analytics

Adhering to Jan's privacy preserving philosophy, our analytics philosophy is to get `barely-enough-to-function`.

#### What is tracked

1. By default, Github tracks downloads and device metadata for all public Github repos. This helps us troubleshoot & ensure cross platform support.
1. We use Posthog to track a single `app.opened` event without additional user metadata, in order to understand retention.
1. Additionally, we plan to enable a `Settings` feature for users to turn off all tracking.

#### Request for help

As a result, our feature prioritization can feel a bit black box at times.

We'd appreciate high quality insights and volunteers for user interviews through [Discord](https://discord.gg/af6SaTdzpx) and [Github](https://github.com/janhq).
